# React with Vite

This template offers a streamlined configuration to integrate React with Vite, featuring Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and pre-configured ESLint rules for code quality.

Currently, two official plugins are supported:

(@vitejs/plugin-react): [Utilizes Babel to enable Fast Refresh.]
(@vitejs/plugin-react-swc): [Leverages SWC for Fast Refresh]
